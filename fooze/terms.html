<h3 class="hdrtitle left">POLICIES AND TERMS OF SERVICE</h3>
<h3 class="hdrtitle left">Missed Orders</h3>

Our couriers will try to contact you upon arrival, either in-person, by phone, text, and/or email. If we cannot get in touch with you after 5 minutes, your order will be forfeited. No refunds may be issued once our courier is reassigned to their next order

<h3 class="hdrtitle left">Incorrect Delivery or Order</h3>

<p>If there was a mistake with your order or delivery, send us an email at info@foozeapp.com detailing the issue so we can quickly find a resolution. We'll adjust the order for billing purposes, if needed, and will follow up with the restaurant and courier. We can only make adjustments within one week of your order date. After one week, the order is final.</p>
<p>
Please note, it is not Fooze’s policy to issue credits from Fooze for grievances regarding recipes, portions and/or pricing, as these are all factors that are determined by the restaurant’s chef and management staff. However, we can present your request to their staff and follow up with you with the restaurant's proposed solution, be it monetary or otherwise.
</p>

<h3 class="hdrtitle left">Cancellations and Refund Eligibility</h3> 
Orders are received by the restaurant and prepared as soon as you tap the confirm button. Cancellations are subject to approval of the restaurant staff and dependent on whether or not the order has been started. If your meal is already in production, no refunds may be issued
